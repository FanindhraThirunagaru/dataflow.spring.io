# Programming Models

Spring Cloud Stream provides the flexibility to build the streaming applications by using different programming models.

- Imperative
- Functional
- Kafka Streams

In the sections that follow, we review how a single example of business logic can be built with different programming models.

To highlight the use of programming with a concrete example, consider a scenario in which we receive data from an HTTP endpoint. Once the data is available, we want to transform the payload by adding prefix and suffixes. Finally, we want to verify the transformed data.

## Download Applications

To demonstrate the previously mentioned use case, we start by downloading two out-of-the-box applications:

- [HTTP Source](https://github.com/spring-cloud-stream-app-starters/http)

```bash
wget https://repo.spring.io/release/org/springframework/cloud/stream/app/http-source-kafka/2.1.0.RELEASE/http-source-kafka-2.1.0.RELEASE.jar
```

- [Log Sink](https://github.com/spring-cloud-stream-app-starters/log)

```bash
wget https://repo.spring.io/release/org/springframework/cloud/stream/app/log-sink-kafka/2.1.1.RELEASE/log-sink-kafka-2.1.1.RELEASE.jar
```

## Custom Processor

For the data transformation between the source and sink steps, we highlight a custom processor application and use that as a base to demonstrate different programming models.

**Code:**

<!--TABS-->
<!--Imperative-->

```java
@EnableBinding(Processor.class)
public class SimpleStreamSampleProcessor {

	@StreamListener(Processor.INPUT)
	@SendTo(Processor.OUTPUT)
	public String messenger(String data) {
		return "Hello: " + data + "!";
	}
}
```

<!--Functional-->

```java
public class FunctionStreamSampleProcessor {

	@Bean
	public Function<String, String> messenger() {
		return data -> "Hello: " + data + "!";
	}
}
```

<!--Kafka Streams-->

```java
@EnableBinding(KafkaStreamsProcessor.class)
public class KafkaStreamsSampleProcessor {

	@StreamListener("input")
	@SendTo("output")
	public KStream<String, String> messenger(KStream<String, String> data) {
		return data.map((k, v) -> new KeyValue<>(null, "Hello: " + v + "!"));
	}
}
```

<!--END_TABS-->

<!--NOTE-->

The business logic in the processor transforms the received payload by adding the "Hello: " prefix and the "!" suffix.

The same "business logic" can be implemented with different programming models, and each of the variations implements a simple `messenger` function, which can be independently tested and evolved in isolation.

**Takeaway**: Developers have the choice to choose from the available programming model styles.

<!--END_NOTE-->

**Configuration: _(application.properties)_**

<!--TABS-->
<!--Imperative-->

```properties
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.destination=incomingDataTopic
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.destination=outgoingDataTopic
```

<!--Functional-->

```properties
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.destination=incomingDataTopic
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.destination=outgoingDataTopic
```

<!--Kafka Streams-->

```properties
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.destination=incomingDataTopic
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.destination=outgoingDataTopic

spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.binder.applicationId=kstreams-sample
```

<!--END_TABS-->

<!--NOTE-->

In the Kafka Streams configuration, you may have noticed the extra property, `spring.cloud.stream.kafka.streams.binder.applicationId`, which is required by the framework internally to identify the Kafka Streams application uniquely.

## Testing

1. Start Kafka on `localhost`.

2. Clone and build the processor sample from [here](https://github.com/sabbyanandan/stream-programming-models).

3. Start the following applications.

**Source:**

Start the Http-source application with the output destination bound to the `incomingDataTopic` topic in Kafka.

```bash
java -jar http-source-kafka-2.1.0.RELEASE.jar --spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.destination=incomingDataTopic --server.port=9001
```

**Processor:**

Start one of the processor variations from the built directory:

```bash
java -jar simple/target/simple-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

**Sink:**

Finally, start the Log-sink application with the input destination bound to `outgoingDataTopic` topic in Kafka:

```bash
java -jar log-sink-kafka-2.1.1.RELEASE.jar --spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.destination=outgoingDataTopic --server.port=9003
```

Now that the applications are running, you can post some sample data to verify the results.

**Data:**
Post sample data to the port where the HTTP-source application is running (port 9001 in this case):

```bash
curl localhost:9001 -H "Content-type: text/plain" -d "test data"
```

**Results:**
In the Log-sink application console, we should now see output similar to the following:

```bash
2019-04-30 15:03:27.620  INFO 38035 --- [container-0-C-1] log-sink                                 : Hello: test data!
```

With this result, we can verify that the data from the HTTP-source application is processed by the `simple-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT` processor, and the processed data is printed in the console with the "Hello: " prefix and "!" suffix, which produces "Hello: test data!" as a result.

## Composing Functional Beans in Processor Applications

Functional composition support is **not** applicable for the out-of-the-box Spring Cloud Stream `Processor` applications, since there is ambiguity in whether the function needs to be applied before or after the existing processorâ€™s application logic.
It is hard to determine that.

However, you can create your own processor applications that use functional composition with the standard `java.util.Function` APIs, as follow:

```java
@Configuration
public static class FunctionProcessorConfiguration {

  @Bean
  public Function<String, String> upperAndConcat() {
  return upper().andThen(concat());
  }

  @Bean
  public Function<String, String> upper() {
     return value -> value.toUpperCase();
  }

  @Bean
  public Function<String, String> concat() {
     return value -> "Hello "+ value;
  }
}
```

When you deploy your stream with the custom `processor` application, you need to deploy the `processor` application by defining the following property: `spring.cloud.stream.function.definition` to compose functional beans.

In this example, it would be set to:

```properties
spring.cloud.stream.function.definition=upper|concat
```
